This affected internet performance for customers in the northern district, causing intermittent connectivity and reduced bandwidth., Activities:Received multiple alerts from the network monitoring system indicating signal degradation on the port. , Resolution notes: The incident was resolved by identifying and removing contamination on the fiber optic connectors serving port 2/3/5 of SINGSGKGEX0/HUTQ C300/4 OLT. The contamination was causing signal degradation that worsened during high traffic periods. After cleaning the optical interfaces and resetting the port, optical power levels improved from -19.5dBm to -14.2dBm, restoring full bandwidth capacity to all 96 business customers. As a preventive measure, the site has been added to the priority cleaning schedule with quarterly fiber connection inspection and cleaning. Additionally, monitoring thresholds have been adjusted to trigger alerts when optical power levels approach -18dBm rather than waiting until the -20dBm critical threshold\"\"\"},\n",
